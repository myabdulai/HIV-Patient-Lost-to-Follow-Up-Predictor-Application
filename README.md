# Project Title
HIV-Patient-Lost-to-Follow-Up-Predictor-Application

## Overview
- The prevalence of Lost to Follow Up (LFU) is high among PLHIV receiving treatment in Ghana.
- Frequent LFU can cause drug resistance which may lead to serious complications if not properly managed.
- Drug resistance increases cost of the treatment.
- This motivated me to develop this application as my course project to assist in identifying patients who are likely to get LFU at point of care .

## Implementation
- The dataset was imported into python
- A decision-tree model was built.
- The model was evaluated for accuracy, and it achieved 79% accuracy level.
-  A graphic user interface was designed. 
- input data from the graphic user interface is collected, converted into a dataframe and passed to the model for prediction.

## Installation
- Python and libraries were installed to allow for successful implementation of the project.

## Technologies Used
- Programing language: Python
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, joblip, and tKinker
